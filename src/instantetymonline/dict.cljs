  {"else" "Old English elles \"in another manner, other, otherwise, besides, different,\" from Proto-Germanic *aljaz (cognates: Gothic aljis \"other,\" Old High German eli-lenti, Old English el-lende, both meaning \"in a foreign land;\" see also Alsace), an adverbial genitive of the neuter of PIE root *al- (1) \"beyond\" (cognates: Greek allos \"other,\" Latin alius; see alias (adv.)). As a quasi-adjective, synonymous with other, from 1660s; the nuances of usage are often arbitrary.\n\nProductive of a number of handy compounds that somehow never got traction or have been suffered to fall from use: elsehow (1660s) \"somehow or other;\" elsewards (adv.), 1882, \"somewhere else;\" Old English elsewhat (pron.) \" something else, anything else;\" elsewhen (adv.), early 15c., \"at another time; elsewhence (c. 1600); elsewho (1540s). Among the survivors are elsewhere, elsewise. Menacing or else, with omitted but implied threat, is from 1833.", "Ella" "fem. proper name, when not a diminutive of Eleanor it is from Old High German Alia, from al \"all.\"", "elite" "\"a choice or select body, the best part,\" 1823, from French élite \"selection, choice,\" from Old French eslite (12c.), fem. past participle of elire, elisre \"pick out, choose,\" from Latin eligere \"choose\" (see election).

Related: Eliminated; eliminating; eliminative; eliminatory.", "elitism" "1951; see elite + -ism.", "elk" "late Old English elch, from Old Norse elgr or from an alteration of Old English elh, eolh (perhaps via French scribes), or possibly from Middle High German elch (OED's suggestion), all from Proto-Germanic *elkh- (source also of Old High German elaho). The modern word \"is not the normal phonetic representative\" of the Old English one [OED].\n\nThe Germanic words are related to the general word for \"deer\" in Balto-Slavic (such as Russian losu, Czech los; also see eland), from PIE *olki-, perhaps with reference to the reddish color from root *el- (2) \"red, brown\" (in animal and tree names); compare Sanskrit harina- \"deer,\" from hari- \"reddish-brown.\" Greek alke and Latin alces probably are Germanic loan-words. Applied to similar-looking but unrelated animals in North America.

The noun is first attested 1859.\n\nJohn Knox, one of the exiles for religion in Switzerland, publiſhed his \"Firſt Blaſt of the Trumpet againſt the Government of Women,\" in this reign [of Elizabeth].

Sense of \"run away in defiance of parental authority to marry secretly\" is 19c. \n\nIn support of this OED compares Old English uðleapan, \"the technical word for the 'escaping' of a thief.\" However there is an Anglo-French aloper \"run away from a husband with one's lover\" (mid-14c.) which complicates this etymology; perhaps it is a modification of the Middle Dutch word, with Old French es-, or it is a compound of that and Middle English lepen \"run, leap\" (see leap (v.)).\n\nThe oldest Germanic word for \"wedding\" is represented by Old English brydlop (cognates: Old High German bruthlauft, Old Norse bruðhlaup), literally \"bride run,\" the conducting of the woman to her new home.

Related: Elocutionary; elocutionist.", "ellipse" "1753, from French ellipse (17c.), from Latin ellipsis \"ellipse,\" also, \"a falling short, deficit,\" from Greek elleipsis (see ellipsis). So called because the conic section of the cutting plane makes a smaller angle with the base than does the side of the cone, hence, a \"falling short.\" The Greek word was first applied by Apollonius of Perga (3c.
