suffix -rel. Earlier \"something useless or imperfect\" (1790).", "flotsam (n.)"
"c. 1600, from Anglo-French floteson, from Old French flotaison \"a floating\"
(Modern French flottaison), from floter \"to float, set afloat\" (of Germanic
origin; see flotilla) + -aison, from Latin -ation(em). Spelled flotsen in
English till mid-19c. when it altered, perhaps under influence of many English
words in -some. Folk-etymologized in dialect as floatsome.\n\nIn British law,
flotsam are goods found floating on the sea as a consequence of a shipwreck or
action of wind or waves; jetsam are things cast out of a ship in danger of being
wrecked, and afterward washed ashore, or things cast ashore by the sailors.
Whatever sinks is lagan. Flotsam and jetsam figuratively for \"odds and ends\"
is attested by 1861.", "ullage (n.)" "\"amount by which a cask or bottle falls
short of being full,\" late 15c., from Anglo-French ulliage (early 14c.),
Anglo-Latin oliagium (late 13c.), Old French ouillage, from ouiller \"to fill up
(a barrel) to the bung,\" literally \"to fill to the eye,\" from ueil \"eye\"
(perhaps used colloquially for \"bung\"), from Latin oculus (see eye (n.))."}
