# instantetymonline

I wanted to make the https://instantdomainsearch.com version of
http://etymonline.com/.

## TODO

- Deploy to check network etc
- Add copyright to footer
- Nicer CSS
- Autocomplete? (https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent-cookbook/blob/master/recipes/autocomplete/src/cljs/autocomplete/core.cljs)
- Advanced compilation?
